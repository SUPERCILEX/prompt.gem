# Customizations

These variables can be updated in your local.conf.sh file, or by other gems.

HOST_COLOR                  set to a value like "GREEN" to control the color of
                            the username:hostname section, see the color
                            function for all valid options
HIDE_PATHS                  an array of sed expressions to apply to the PWD
                            before including it in the prompt; generally used
                            to hide or abbreviate common paths.
ENV_INFO                    append function-names to this array to have them
                            invoked during prompt-construction and their output
                            included in the prompt. See env_functions.sh for
                            built-in functions.
COMMAND_FINISHED_CALLBACKS  append function-names to this array to be invoked
                            after commands finish, e.g. to send a notification.
                            See callback_functions.sh for built-in functions.

See base.conf.sh for more configurations options.

# Features

tagsh [message]  allows you to "tag" a terminal session with a message, like a
                 note describing the purpose of that session. Appears in the
                 prompt and the terminal title.
